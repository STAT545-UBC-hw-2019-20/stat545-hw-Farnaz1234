# Exercise 1: Basic dplyr

## 1.1 Use filter() to subset the gapminder data to three countries of your choice in the 1970’s

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)

```
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Afghanistan" | country == "China" | country == "France",
        year >= 1970 & year < 1980) %>% 
  arrange(year)
```

## 1.2 Use the pipe operator %>% to select “country” and “gdpPercap” from your filtered dataset in 1.1.
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Afghanistan" | country == "China" | country == "France",
        year >= 1970 & year < 1980) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  select(country, gdpPercap)
```

## 1.3 Filter gapminder to all entries that have experienced a drop in life expectancy. Be sure to include a new variable that’s the increase in life expectancy in your tibble. Hint: you might find the lag() or diff() functions useful.
```{r, ecco = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(diff_lifeExp = c(NA, diff(lifeExp, lag = 1, differences = 1))) %>% 
  filter(diff_lifeExp < 0) %>% 
  select(country, year, lifeExp, diff_lifeExp)
```

## 1.4 Filter gapminder so that it shows the max GDP per capita experienced by each country.
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(maxgpdPercap = max(gdpPercap)) %>%
  filter(gdpPercap == maxgpdPercap)
  
```

## 1.5 Produce a scatterplot of Canada’s life expectancy vs. GDP per capita using ggplot2, without defining a new variable. That is, after filtering the gapminder data set, pipe it directly into the ggplot() function. Ensure GDP per capita is on a log scale.
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Canada") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp))+
  labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy")+
  scale_x_log10()+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  theme_classic()
```

# Exercise 2: Explore individual variables with dplyr

## 2.1 What are possible values (or range, whichever is appropriate) of each variable?
For the "continent" variable, the values are:
```{r}
levels(gapminder$continent)
```

For the "lifeExp" variable in 2007, the range is:
```{r}
summary(gapminder$lifeExp[gapminder$year == 1977])[c(1,6)]
```

## 2.2 What values are typical? What’s the spread? What’s the distribution? Etc., tailored to the variable at hand.

The distribution of the life expectancy world wide in 1977:
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1977) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp))+
  geom_density()+
  theme_bw()
```

This distribution is skewed to the right. Therefore, the mode could be considered as a typical value.
```{r}
life1977 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1977) %>% 
  select(lifeExp)  
den <- density(life1977$lifeExp)
print(paste("The mode of this distribution is", round(den$x[which.max(den$y)],digits = 2), sep = " "))
```
Standard deviation is one of the measures of spread.
```{r}
print(paste("The mode of this distribution is", round(sd(life1977$lifeExp), digits = 2), sep = " "))
```

# Exercise 3: Explore various plot types

## 3.1 A scatterplot of two quantitative variables
```{r, warning=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1977) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pop, gdpPercap, color = continent))+
  scale_x_log10()+
  geom_point()+
  stat_smooth(method = "lm")+
  theme_classic()
  
```

## 3.2 One other plot besides a scatterplot
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1952) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent, lifeExp))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_classic()
```
